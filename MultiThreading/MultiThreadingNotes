One task lets say MsWord that is one process

MsWord -> Main process
Typing - Sub process
Spelling check - Sub process

These sub-process are called threads(Unit of a process)

Octa core cpu -> means we have 8 cores

when you create or run a java application you only 
use one thread

If you have added the logic of addition of two number
you already have used one thread

The exception we get is in exception in thread main 
so main is a thread

In every java application we have atleast one thread as main

// MultiThreading(use)

 1 -> lets say we 4 core, in all 4 core there is 4 different thread running and the main thread is calling all the three different thread so the task we were able to do before in 5 sec now can be done in 2sec approx

2 -> To do async task(Api call)
the main thread will not make the api call the other thread will do this so that we can use our app in background instead of getting stuck
One thread will interact with the user, the second thread will be gping for the server request

3 -> web application
when you send a request from client to server using servlet
if there are 5 different user then there will be 5 different thread working with servlet to call server from client side

Thread is a inbuilt class in java
Thread t1 = new Thread();

It doesnot know what to do 
so you will create your own thread class 

and every thread class should have method run

run is responsible for the task you want to do

class MyThread extends Thread{
  int[] values = {6,5,1,7,8};
  public void run(){
    for(int i = 0; i<5; i++){
       values[i] = values[i] * 2;
    }
 }
}

Thread t1 = new MyThread();
t1.run();

By default we have main thread here
Parallely if you want to start a new thread
if you call start method it will automatically call run method

sleep is a static method which takes millisecond
wait, notify

In java we canot achieve multiple inheritance thats why we use a interface Runnable

other way to create a thread

class A{

}

class MyThread extends A implements Runnable{

}
