1 - Runnable

Runnable interface is a functional interface, which implements the run method. run() method is a void method. 
execute() method of the Executor Thread-pool took Runnable interface as parameter.

2 - Callable

Callable is also a functional interface as similar as the Runnable interface. which implements call() method. it has a return type.
 it is not an void method. submit() method of the ExecutorThread-pool took Callable interface as parameter. it will give results as Future

 Callable is similar to Runnable and can return any type of object when we want to get a result or status from the task.

 The callable class has just one method “call ()” that holds all the code needed to execute asynchronously.

 In a runnable interface environment, there was no possibility to return the result of the computation or throw checked exception. 
 Whereas with Callable returning a value and throwing a checked exception is available.
