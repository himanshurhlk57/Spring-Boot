OAuth 2.0

OAuth 2.0, which stands for "Open Authorization", is a standard designed to
allow a website or application to access resources hosted by other web apps
on behalf of a user

OAuth 2.0
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol and NOT an authentication
protocol.
• It is designed primarily as a means of granting access to a set of
resources, for example, remote APIs or user's data.
OAuth 2.0 uses Access Tokens

OAuth 2.0 Roles
• Resource Owner
• Client
• Authorization Server
• Resource Server

Resource Owner
The user or system that owns the protected resources and can grant
access to them

Client
The client is the system that requires access to the protected
resources. To access resources, the Client must hold the appropriate
Access Token

Authorization
Server
This server receives requests from the Client for Access Tokens and
issues them upon successful authentication and consent by the
Resource Owner.

Resource Server
A server that protects the user's resources and receives access
requests from the Client. It accepts and validates an Access Token
from the Client and returns the appropriate resources to it.
