Annotation

@Component -> you need to start managing the instance of these class
public class ComplexBusinessService{

  @Autowired -> this sortAlgorithm is the dependency of ComplexBusinessService
  SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm;
}

@Component
public class BubbleSortAlgorithm implements SortAlgorithm{

}

SpringBoot will interally do this 
SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm = new BubbleSortAlgorithm();
ComplexBusinessService businessService = new ComplexBusinessService(sortAlgorithm)
