Integertion Testing known as doing unit test for the 
entier application

currently we have service layer, repository, controller layer 
you can test all those three layer differently as well 
or you can test all the three layer at the same time using Integertion testing

JUnit and mockito are added to our application by defult in 
our spring application as a spring boot starter test dependency

will use JUnit5 and mockito to test all of our component
we have created

Testing is typically done to make sure that the
functionality of the application is as expected.

Unit testing is testing a specific method or a class

class Class1{
  method1
  method2
  method3
}

Unit testing is writing individual test for each of these
class method, or for a group of methods, or for a specific class

JUnit is a framework which will help you to call these 
specific method and check whether the output is as expected
