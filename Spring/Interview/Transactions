@Modifying Annotation

A method to modify the value in our database we need to use @Modifying annotation

 @Transactional -> A transaction will be created, all the operation insert, delete, update. We can do all those things and at the end after the particular operation is performed, when that particular method is completed, that particular transaction will be commited to the database.
 Ideally they are added in the service layer

For being considered as a transaction, all processes inside should be executed successfully. If one process fails, all transactions is failed. This is the transactional principle.

Using @Transactional 

 In a transaction, if a single process fails then all transactions should fail. We can implement this behavior using @Transactional annotation.

 @Transactional will make sure all our operations are successfully executed, if not, it will roll back all operations at the database as if nothing happened.


 I dont want to keep un used data in our database in case all the function doesn't executed successfully. 
 The passenger info is saved while the payment hasn't successed so in this case i dont want to store data of passenger

 If everything successed then commit that data to database if anything goes wrong then rollback that data from the database
