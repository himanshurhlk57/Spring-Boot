maven is a build tool
so if you want to create a project you want a project structure, you want something that will compile your file, you want something that will test your application, and you want something that will give you all the required library



project
groupId - com.telusko
artifactid - demo
package - com.telusko.demo.web

maven or gradle

we want the project we created ourself to be unique 
so we combine the groupId and artifactid

groupId will define your package

all the project i will create will be part of com.himanshu

artifactid will represent your project name

package mame - com.himanshu.demo.web

the dependency add .jar file

when you are using any dependency for the first time
lets say spring dependency it will get downloaded from the remote repositry

maven has remote repositry 
it also has a local repositry now every time you ask for dependency now it will first search for local repositry if it is not there it will go to remote repositry
